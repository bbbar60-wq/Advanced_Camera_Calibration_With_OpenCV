        "\n",
        "With the script in place, let's break down the key computer vision concepts and code sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.1 The `CameraCalibrator` Class\n",
        "\n",
        "The entire logic is encapsulated within this class. The `__init__` method sets up the essential parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`chessboard_dims`**: The number of *inner* corners of the chessboard (e.g., a 9x6 board has 8x5 inner corners).\n",
        "* **`objp`**: The \"object points\". This is a crucial concept. We create an ideal, 3D representation of the chessboard corners in a perfect grid, assuming it lies on the Z=0 plane. The goal of calibration is to find the mapping between these perfect 3D points and the distorted 2D points detected in the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.2 Calibration Logic (`calibrate_from_directory`)\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the core of the calibration process. It iterates through images and:\n",
        "1.  **Finds Corners**: Uses `cv2.findChessboardCorners()` to locate the corners of the chessboard pattern in the 2D image.\n",
        "2.  **Refines Corners**: Uses `cv2.cornerSubPix()` to find the corner locations with sub-pixel accuracy, which is critical for a good calibration.\n",
        "3.  **Builds Point Mappings**: For every image where corners are found, it stores the ideal 3D `obj_points` and the detected 2D `img_points`.\n",
        "4.  **Calculates Parameters**: After processing all images, it passes these point mappings to `cv2.calibrateCamera()`. This powerful function uses all the data to mathematically solve for the camera's intrinsic parameters:\n",
        "    * **`mtx` (Camera Matrix)**: Contains the focal lengths (fx, fy) and the optical center (cx, cy) of the camera.\n",
        "    * **`dist` (Distortion Coefficients)**: Contains the values (k1, k2, p1, p2, k3) that mathematically describe the lens distortion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.3 FOV and Data Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`_calculate_fov`**: This new method takes the focal lengths (`fx`, `fy`) from the camera matrix and the image dimensions to calculate the camera's horizontal and vertical Field of View in degrees. This provides immediate, practical information about the camera's properties.\n",
        "* **`save_parameters` / `load_parameters`**: These methods handle data persistence. The new version intelligently saves to either NumPy's binary `.npz` format or a human-readable `.json` format based on the filename, and can load from either.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.4 Interactive Undistortion (`undistort_interactive`)\n",
        "\n",
        "This mode showcases the practical application of calibration.\n",
        "* It uses `cv2.getOptimalNewCameraMatrix()` with a trackbar-controlled `alpha` value. The `alpha` parameter controls how much of the original image is retained after undistortion.\n",
        "    * `alpha=0`: The undistorted image is zoomed and cropped so that only valid pixels are visible (no black borders).\n",
        "    * `alpha=1`: All original pixels are retained, which often results in black, curved borders where the image was warped.\n",
        "* This interactivity allows a user to find the perfect balance for their specific needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.5 Reprojection Error Visualization (`live_reprojection_error`)\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a key method for assessing calibration quality.\n",
        "1.  It first detects the chessboard corners in the live feed (`refined_corners`).\n",
        "2.  It then uses `cv2.solvePnP()` to find the real-time 3D position and orientation of the board relative to the camera.\n",
        "3.  Finally, it uses `cv2.projectPoints()` to take the *ideal* 3D object points (`self.objp`) and, using the calculated camera parameters and board position, re-projects them back into the 2D image plane.\n",
        "4.  By drawing both the detected (green) and re-projected (red) points, it provides a direct visual measurement of the calibration error. **The smaller the distance between the green and red markers, the better the calibration.**\n",

        "We have successfully built and analyzed an advanced, professional-grade camera calibration tool. It is structured, reusable, and provides powerful interactive features for both calibration and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "* The project demonstrates an end-to-end computer vision workflow.\n",
        "* It moves beyond basic scripting by using a class-based structure and command-line arguments.\n",
        "* It incorporates advanced features like FOV calculation, interactive parameter tuning, and visual accuracy assessment with reprojection error, showcasing a deep understanding of the topic.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tool serves as a robust foundation for any future computer vision projects that require a calibrated camera, such as augmented reality, 3D reconstruction, or robotic vision.\n",
